This is the repo containing the code used in Chapter 4 of the PhD thesis: From Migmatites to Granitoids: Migration Mechanisms, Timescale, and Melt Source from Hugo Dominguez (2014). All the code is written using Julia and was developed using the version 1.10.5. 

It contains two folders: ThermalModelElOro.jl and MeltingCrust.jl. ThermalModelElOro.jl contains the code used to produce 1D thermal models, whereas MeltingCrust.jl contains the code used to couple the 1D convection dominated thermal model with MAGEMin, a Gibbs free energy minimiser. 

Each folder contains instruction on how the code is organised and on how to reproduce the results presented in the Chapter.

All the code is also stored on a zenodo repository with a permanent [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13854597).
